# Web-Scraping_Challenge
Background

This is web-scraping and data analysis project. This project we have to use HTML elements on a page, identify their id and class attributes, and use this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. This involves scraping various types of information including HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage. 

Deliverables:

1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.

2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table, create Dataframes and charts   
using Pandas, and export file to a CVS.
